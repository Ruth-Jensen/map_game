## Overview

**Project Title**: Escape the Mansion Text Adventure

**Project Description**: It's a text adventure written in java. the goal of the game is to escape the mansion

**Project Goals**: My goal for this project is to learn java by rewriting an old project in a new language. My how is that since I already wrote this project once it'll making it easier for me to learn this new language and maybe I'll even improve my old project in the process

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. install java extension for VS Code

Instructions for using the software:

1. open a terminal in VS Code to run the game. Make sure the terminal is as large as it can be. Collapse any side panels you have in VS Code in order to increase the width. If the terminal ends up being to small the visuals on the screen might look weird
2. Run the program
3. Use WASD to move vertically and horizontally QEZC to move around diagonally and use the x and space bar to go up and down. If you forget what keys to press, it will tell you on the left side of the screen 
4. The goal of the game is to find the key to the mansion and escape. The mansion key is in the secret room, and the key to the secret room is in the east wing
5. The keys to perform any other action are on the left side of the screen. Just type the number to perform the corresponding action.
